Orion Defensive AI Research:: Very new experimental good times. In need of Firepower.

See [Welcome](https://github.com/orion-constellation/orion-advertorch-0.01/blob/b1a02c42ef9183637e83fb0a6314c3f8872a2cdc/WELCOME.md) (Apologies for code messiness - solo project until now and lots of redundancy etc but feel free to raise an issue).

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring the intersection of privacy-preserving technologies and adversarial machine learning within the PyTorch ecosystem. On 10 May 2024, we embarked on an innovative project that leverages Crypten for encrypted computations and advertorch for managing adversarial data, creating a robust training environment aimed at developing new heuristics for machine learning models and Reinforcement Learning for new heuristics

### Project Goals
1. Experiment with Adversarial Attacks: Utilize advertorch to generate and defend against adversarial attacks, enhancing our models' robustness.
2. Utilise "Ephemeral Knowledge Graphs" to model multi-stage attack vectors.
3. Utilise KG's to model MITREAttack Library for automatic matching against table based on probability score.
4. Provide reporting.

### Requirements
Python: Version 3.8 or higher.
Rust: Latest stable release.
PyTorch: For neural network computations.
Crypten: For encrypted machine learning.
advertorch: For adversarial attack simulation and defence.
Verida.ts: For secure data storage solutions.
Red Panda and Timely: For efficient stream processing.
